# powershell-powerups ðŸ’ª
These are some time saving tools in powershell, many of them revolve around git, including branching and jira cards etc.

There are some other general purpose things, like closing all open windows. I have some of these mapped to keyboard shortcuts on my PC by using a program called AutoHotkey.

These are just the powershell scripts, the integration with autohotkey etc. is not part of this repo.

If you are reading this then be aware that this takes some time to setup, but once it's setup there's nothing like hitting a keyboard shortcut and watching a process which might have taken you 30 seconds take place automatically before your eyes ðŸ‘€
Note that Some of the scripts require nircmd.exe to be installed into the working directory
